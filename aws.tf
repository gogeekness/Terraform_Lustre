# this is a terraform file "*.tf"

# terraform is now "commercial/proprietary" hence we go with drop replacement opentofu (free software)
# Opentofu/Terraform work by writing "resources" that one wants to be created
# those resources can then
# a) be easily planned + applyed (i.e. created) 
#    # tofu plan -out ourplan
#    # tofu apply outplan
# b) be as easily removed/deletet/destroyed 
#    # tofu destroy
#
# in this file we setup the "modules" and "terraform" stuff 
# so that aws resources can be managed via terraform
