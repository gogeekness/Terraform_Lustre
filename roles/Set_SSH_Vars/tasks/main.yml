#### Task to define the public_IP and set the facts to use it as teh Bastion IP

## loop through all of the hosts to find the one with a public ip
## Save it for all hosts as a bastion or jump host access
- name: set_fact hostvar of public IP
  set_fact:
    ec2_public_ip: "{{ hostvars[item]['public_ip_address'] }}"  
  when:
    - when: hostvars[item]['public_ip_address'] is defined
    - hostvars[item]['public_ip_address'] != ''
    - ec2_public_ip is not defined
  loop: "{{ ansible_play_hosts }}"
  loop_control: 
    label: "{{ item }}"
    #- inventory_hostname | regex_search("^ec2.*")
  delegate_to: localhost
  run_once: true

## varify that the public IP is aviable to all hosts
- name: Mark ec2 public IP
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: 
      - "{{ inventory_hostname }} The public IP is {{ ec2_public_ip }}"
      - "{{ ansible_host }} IP to connect with"

- name: Debug matching hostnames
  debug:
    msg: "This host matches: {{ inventory_hostname }}"
  when: inventory_hostname is match("^ip-10.*")

- name: Make sure bastion uses public IP
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    ansible_host: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['public_ip_address'] }}"
  when: inventory_hostname is match('^ec2.*')

## define the ssh setting to use the bastion_public_ip so ansible can reach all of the servers
## Good ssh: ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/lustretest ec2-user@public_ip
## ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/lustretest -J ec2-user@52.29.192.136:22 ec2-user@10.0.1.x
## Then I use the client as the jumphost/bastion so a direct connection is needed.
- name: Set SSH ProxyCommand for Specific Hosts
  set_fact:
    ansible_ssh_common_args: >-
      -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p -i {{ ssh_key_location }} ec2-user@{{ ec2_public_ip }}"
  when: inventory_hostname is match("^ip-10.*")
